        <h2>Tuning</h2>
        <br><p>The first and most important skill to learn as a guitarist is to master the 
            act of tuning the guitar. To tune a guitar an electronic tuner can be used 
            but useful skill for any guitarist is the ability to tune by ear. <br> 
            The guitar can be tuned to the poitn where all the strings are 'in tune' with
            one another but if you are playing the guitar as a group then the correct pitch is needed. <br>
            The guitar is tuned as follows, with the thickest string being the lowest note and
            the thinest string being the highest note.

        <h2>Simple Chord Sequences</h2><br>
        <p>A chord sequence is a series of chords played in a specific order. To play a major chord on the guitar, 
            you'll need to play the root note, as well as the third and fifth notes of the major scale. To play a minor chord, 
            you'll need to play the root note, the third note of the minor scale, and the fifth note of the major scale. 
            Here are some examples of simple chord sequences that you can use to play a variety of different styles of music:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The 4-chord sequence: This is commonly used in pop and rock music and consists of four chords arranged 
                in the pattern I-IV-V-IV.</li>
            <li>The 12-bar blues: This is commonly used in blues music and consists of 12 bars of music with 
                three chords per bar, arranged in the pattern I-IV-I-I-IV-IV-I-I-V-IV-I-I.</li>
            <li>The 2-5-1 sequence: This is commonly used in jazz music and consists of three chords played in the pattern II-V-I.</li>
            <li>The 3-chord sequence: This is very simple and consists of only three chords. It is often used in folk and country music 
                and can be played in a variety of different ways, such as the pattern I-IV-V.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            With practice and experimentation, you'll be able to come up with your own chord sequences and play a wide range of songs on the guitar.
